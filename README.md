# Note-Taking App with Firebase

## Progress:
- **Firebase Integration:** Firebase Authentication is set up for email/password login.
- **UI:** Login Screen and basic Home Screen are implemented.
- **Firestore Setup:** Firebase Firestore is integrated, but CRUD operations for notes are not working yet.
- **State Management:** Provider is added but not fully integrated with the app.

## Issues:
- CRUD operations (add, edit, delete notes) are not functional.
- Notes are not displayed on the Home Screen.
- Some Firebase and Firestore errors need to be fixed.

## Next Steps:
- Implement CRUD functionality for notes.
- Connect UI with Firestore to display notes.
- Fix state management and Firebase integration.
